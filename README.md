## Hi. I'm Tyler.
I'm a Digital Analyst by title, but I primarily work on engineering custom and adhoc analytics solutions.
Mostly using Python, DAX, and SQL in the Microsoft Azure/Power BI ecosystem.

I also have a working familiarity with Linux OS, AWS tools (S3, Lambda, SageMaker), BigQuery, and Databricks.

Current Project: Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy text -> QA JSON -> finetuning LLM
Current interests: ML in Databricks
